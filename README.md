## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an effective model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), we aim to classify each image into one of the ten digit categories (0-9).

## Dataset

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

### Dataset Source
- [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the model includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features from the input images.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Performs the final classification of the features.

### Key Libraries Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
